# The tests of hour 4's four folders, workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-1 to step-4 (decision
# 8271, 4 November: Javier opens a folder, tells Copilot to run ticket 010 from there, and
# says which memory just came in). Each folder is a whole state of Northbank's world, the
# example team of memory/CASES.md: its own DOMAIN.md, STANDING.md, a small app of Harbour
# POS, the graph and ticket 010, a discount on a sale. One rule decides the ticket, the one
# case 7 of the memory holds: a discount goes per line, never on the total, rounded per
# line to the penny (Priya, 19 February). The reviewer knows it in every folder; where the
# worker can find it is the only thing that changes:
#   step-1  nowhere                      the run ends red: the reviewer blocks
#   step-2  DOMAIN.md                    green
#   step-3  the worker skill             green
#   step-4  only the memory, quoted into the ticket by the chief before launch: green
# Each folder keeps the run it was proved with, by real Copilot agents, in
# graph/runs/010-sale-discount/: what Javier shows when a live run is slow.
