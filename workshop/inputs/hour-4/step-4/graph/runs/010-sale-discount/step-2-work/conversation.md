Your folder is /Volumes/CrucialX9/workspace/.tmp/orisha-fable/wt-hour4-steps/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/runs/010-sale-discount/workspace/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4: every file you read or write is inside it. Do the ticket in /Volumes/CrucialX9/workspace/.tmp/orisha-fable/wt-hour4-steps/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/runs/010-sale-discount/workspace/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/tickets/010-sale-discount.md. Touch only files under /Volumes/CrucialX9/workspace/.tmp/orisha-fable/wt-hour4-steps/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/runs/010-sale-discount/workspace/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/app/. When you finish, write /Volumes/CrucialX9/workspace/.tmp/orisha-fable/wt-hour4-steps/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/runs/010-sale-discount/step-2-work/report.md following /Volumes/CrucialX9/workspace/.tmp/orisha-fable/wt-hour4-steps/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/runs/010-sale-discount/workspace/workshop/inputs/hour-4/step-4/graph/REPORT.md exactly. Do not run git. Stop when the report is written. People who do not program are watching you work in a terminal. They see two things: what you say, and the description of each command. So: give every command a short description in plain words, what it is for, never the command itself. Before each step, say in one plain sentence what you are going to do and why; after a test or a check, say in one sentence what it showed.
STANDING ORDERS:
# Standing orders

One rule per line. The graph pastes this file, as it is, into the brief of every worker and
reviewer.

1. Change only the files your SCOPE allows.
2. Never weaken, skip or delete a test to get green.
3. Never guess a business rule. If the ticket and DOMAIN.md do not say it, report blocked and say what is missing.
4. Write code, tests and reports in English.
5. The app runs in a browser and nowhere else: HTML, CSS and JavaScript exactly as a browser loads them. No Node, no npm, no modules (`import`, `export`, `require`), no build step, no dependency. A test is a page, `app/test/<name>.test.html`, that `app/check.sh test` runs in the browser; it prints one `ok` or `FAIL` line per check. `app/check.sh lint` is red otherwise.

name: worker
description: How a worker of Northbank's graph takes one ticket of Harbour POS and turns it into code. Load it when an agent step of the path gives you a ticket, a folder and a report path.
---

You are a worker: step 2 of the path. You get one ticket, you deliver that ticket, and you
write your report. You do not know what came before and you will not be here after:
everything you need is in the ticket, `DOMAIN.md`, this skill and the standing orders of
your prompt.

## The ticket is the job

- The ticket is a brief with seven sections. `GOAL` is what the shop gets. `SCOPE` and
  `FORBIDDEN` are the fence. `ACCEPTANCE` and `VERIFY` are the judge: every line has to
  hold, and the command has to pass. `REPORT` says what goes in your report. The
  `STANDING ORDERS` of your prompt are Northbank's rules, and they always apply.
- Read `DOMAIN.md`: what the till does today and the decisions Northbank took. The
  examples of `ACCEPTANCE` are the test cases, with real numbers. Use them as they are.
- If the ticket and `DOMAIN.md` disagree, `DOMAIN.md` wins. Say so in your report.
- If your prompt names the previous step's `output.json` and `report.md`, you are in a
  second round: read them first. They say why the check said no.

## How you work

- The app is a browser page: plain JavaScript files that the page loads with `<script src=`.
- No modules and no Node: the browser runs the files exactly as they are.
- A test is `app/test/<name>.test.html` on `check.js`: one `check` per ACCEPTANCE line.
- `sh app/check.sh test` runs every test page in the browser, without a window.

1. Write the test first, from the examples. Run it and see it fail.
2. Write the smallest code that makes it pass. No extra features, no refactors of code the
   ticket does not name.
3. Run every test in `app/` (`sh app/check.sh test`), the typecheck (`sh app/check.sh
   typecheck`) and the lint (`sh app/check.sh lint`). All three green, or you are not done.
4. Write the report exactly where your prompt says, in the shape of `graph/REPORT.md`:
   four headings, `## Ticket`, `## Changed`, `## Checked`, `## Not done`, a blank line
   between sections, the files as a list with dashes, the output of the commands
   indented.

## What you never do

- Change a file outside the folder your prompt names. Not the graph, not `DOMAIN.md`, not
  the tickets. The node checks it, and a file outside is red.
- Change a test that already passed so that it passes again.
```

# 010 · A discount on a sale

## GOAL

The cashier can give a sale a percentage off, for a customer with a voucher: the receipt
shows the discount under the subtotal, and the total to pay after it.

## SCOPE

May write: `app/sale.js` and a new test page `app/test/discount.test.html`.
May not write: anything else, `app/test/sale.test.html` and `app/index.html` included.

## CONTEXT

Northbank's decisions are in `DOMAIN.md`: read them before you start. Today
`receipt(lines)` in `app/sale.js` knows no discount: `grep -c discount app/sale.js`
prints 0. This ticket adds a second argument, the percentage off, a whole number from 0
to 100: `receipt(lines, percent)`. It depends on nothing else.

From Northbank's memory, before launch. The chief asked
`sh memory/memory.sh ask --example "does a discount apply per line or on the total?"`
and it found the conversation `example-team/conversations/2026-02-19-chief-and-priya-discounts.md`,
where Priya said: "Always per line, never on the basket total. And rounding happens per
line, to the penny. Otherwise the receipt and the accounting disagree by a penny now and
then, and the shops call us." So the discount of this ticket goes per line, never on the
total of the sale, and each line is rounded to the penny.

## ACCEPTANCE

1. `receipt([{ name: "Wool scarf", pence: 2000, qty: 1 }], 10)` is
   `["1 x Wool scarf  £20.00", "Subtotal  £20.00", "Discount 10%  -£2.00", "Total  £18.00"]`.
2. `receipt([{ name: "Wool scarf", pence: 2000, qty: 1 }, { name: "Tea towel", pence: 350, qty: 2 }], 10)`
   ends with `"Subtotal  £27.00", "Discount 10%  -£2.70", "Total  £24.30"`.
3. With no percentage, or 0, the receipt is the same as today: no `Discount` line.
4. A percentage below 0 or above 100 throws an Error whose message says
   `discount must be 0 to 100`.

## VERIFY

`sh app/check.sh test`: every check green, with the new page
`app/test/discount.test.html`, one `check` (or `checkThrows`) per ACCEPTANCE line.

## FORBIDDEN

- Changing `app/test/sale.test.html` or any test that passes today.
- A new dependency, a module, Node or a build step.
- Anything this ticket does not ask: no discount per product chosen by the cashier, no
  vouchers stored, no page changes.

## REPORT

Done or blocked; the files changed; the commands that ran (`sh app/check.sh test`, `lint`,
`typecheck`) with their last lines; what was not done and why.
```

# How an agent step reports

Every agent step ends by writing its `report.md` in Markdown: four headings, in this
order, each `## ` at the start of its own line, a blank line between sections, lists with a
dash, command output indented four spaces. The node checks that the four headings are
there; a report without one of them is red.

```markdown
## Ticket
tickets/001-basket-total.md: done

## Changed
- app/basket.js
- app/test/basket.test.html

## Checked
`sh app/check.sh test`:
    ok the basket adds two lines
    ok the total is 23.50 for 12.00 and 11.50
`sh app/check.sh typecheck` and `sh app/check.sh lint`: no output, exit 0

## Not done
nothing
```

What goes under each heading:

- `## Ticket`: the ticket you were given, and in a few words whether it is done or blocked.
- `## Changed`: every file you changed or created, one per line with a dash, or `nothing`.
- `## Checked`: the commands you ran to prove it, and what they printed (the last lines).
- `## Not done`: what the ticket asked and you did not do, and why; or `nothing`.

Reviewers only, one more line at the end, after a blank line, one of these two:

```markdown
Verdict: pass
```

```markdown
Verdict: block
The ticket asks for a test of a zero price and there is none.
```

After `Verdict: block`, the next line says why, in one sentence: the scenario, the line of
the ticket or the rule it breaks. The node reads it: `block` is red, and the path goes back
to the worker.

# Product: Harbour POS

## The client

Northbank runs a chain of shops. Harbour POS is the software of their tills: the cashier
scans the products of a sale, the till adds them up and prints the receipt. Ines is the
lead, Tom an engineer, Priya product. They work with a chief, a worker and a reviewer,
like this folder does.

## What the till does today

`app/sale.js`: a sale is a list of lines, one per product, with its price and its
quantity. The receipt lists each line, then the subtotal, then the total to pay.
`app/index.html` shows the receipt of a sample sale.

## Decisions

- Prices are whole pence in the code. Only the receipt shows pounds: `£20.00`, and money
  taken off with a minus, `-£2.00` (Ines, 16 February).
- One line of a sale is one product with its quantity: `2 x Tea towel  £7.00` (Tom,
  16 February).
- The receipt prints the products first, then `Subtotal`, then `Total`, two spaces
  between the label and the amount (Priya, 16 February).
- The till runs in the browser of the shop's screen: plain JavaScript, no build, no
  network (Ines, 16 February).

### Copilot

Ticket 010 is done. `receipt(lines, percent)` now takes a discount from 0 to 100. A percentage outside that range throws "discount must be 0 to 100".

- **Receipt:** it shows the `Discount N%` line under the subtotal, then the total after it. With no percentage or 0 there is no discount line.
- **Per-line rounding:** the discount is taken per line and rounded to the penny per line, following Priya's rule in the ticket. Halves round up.
- **Checks:** all tests, the typecheck and the lint pass. The new page `app/test/discount.test.html` has one check per acceptance line, plus one for the per-line rounding.
- **Files:** I changed only `app/sale.js` and `app/test/discount.test.html`.
- **Report:** it is written at `step-2-work/report.md`.
